                    <h2>When to use this pattern</h2>
                    <p>Use this pattern to highlight the potentially serious consequences of performing an action, such as unprovisioning a device or assigning excess privileges to users.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>This will allow users a second chance to check their work before proceeding with a dangerous action. However, it’s not a second chance at all if users automate their response to the conformation and simply click Yes without thinking further.   
                    </p>
                    <h2>When not to use this pattern</h2>
                    <p>Do not use confirmation dialogs for routine actions.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Double confirmation dialogs present an interruption initiated by the system; they slow down the user’s task flow. If this delay prevents an error, then it’s time well spent, but, if not, they are disruptive and thus annoying.   
                    </p>
                    <h2>Pattern checklist</h2>
                    <p>You should help users find out whether or not they want to perform a risky action as soon as you can.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="bullet-list">
                        <li>Provide a title that conveys the event, and calls to action that match. </li>
                        <li>Be specific and inform users about the consequence of their action. Do not ask "Are you sure you want to do this?" Instead, explain what this is, in user-centric terms that are easy to understand and make it likely that the user would recognize a risk.</li>
                        <li>Instead of Yes/No answers, provide response options that summarise what will happen for each possible response. For example, in the case of file deletion, use buttons labeled “Delete file” and “Keep file”.</li>
                        <li>Avoid giving confirmation dialogs a default Yes answer.</li>
                        <li>For particularly dangerous operations, require a nonstandard action from the user to confirm. Rather than simply clicking an OK button (or, better, a button with a word or two to describe the action) — which risks becoming an automated behaviour — have people do something they would normally not do. For example, type a word into a box.</li>
                        <li>Consider an option that allows the user to bypass future routine confirmations. (Such as ‘Don't ask me this again’.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Test the dialog with real users</h2>
                    <p>Test your copy with real users. You will likely need to iterate 2-4 times to get the right pattern.  Each iteration can be tested with 4-5 participants to assess the intuitiveness of the interaction and copy. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Pattern anatomy</h2>
                    <p>This is a general guideline for designing your modal.<br>

                        <li>"Affirmative" verb is left-most. This proceeds with the action.</li>
                        <li>"Negative verb" is right-most. This cancels the action."</li>
                        <li>Primary action uses the primary button style. This is usually the affirmative action, but not always.</li>
                        <li>Primary focus for destructive actions should be on the "negative action".</li>
                        <li>All bottons reside on a single bottom row, aligned right with 12px between each button.</li>
                        <li>The general width for a dialog is 360. Width can increase if necessary in increments of 60px.</li>
