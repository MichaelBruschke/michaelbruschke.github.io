            <h1>Principles</h1><br>
            <p>
                We have evolved our design language to create a design which is human, universal and truly feels like Osirium. These principles guide us to deliver the best-in-class Privileged Access and Automation technology.
            </p><br>
            <h2>Effortless</h2>
            <p>
                Osirium is slick and intuitive. Itâ€™s easy for our users to do what they want with focus and precision.
            </p>
            <h2>Complete and coherent</h2>
            <p>
                Osirium offers a visually seamless experience across platforms. Our users can work with any of our products and have a consistent Osirium experience.
            </p>
            <h2>Worse is better</h2>
            <p>
                Quality does not always rise with functionality. We know that our market favours technology with slick and light-weight features that work over far more complex, heavy technologies of our compititors. We know our customers prioritise ease of usability.
            </p>
            <h2>Stay calm and carry on</h2>
            <p>
                We won't alarm our users. Be casual and offer to lend a hand by providing the information a user needs without unnecessary information or visual clutter. Always keep focused on leading your user to the solution when there's a problem.
            </p>
            <h2>Consistency > trend, but not by much</h2>
            <p>
                As a leading PAM vendor we've shaped our our patterns, flows, and structures that result in an interface of familiar patterns and behavoiurs within the product. We know that some of these patterns buck the trend of "universal patterns" in the commercial space, and that's okay.
